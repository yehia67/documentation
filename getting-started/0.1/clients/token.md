# The IOTA token

**The IOTA token is a unit of value (i, Ki, Mi, Gi, Ti, Pi) that can be transferred over an [IOTA network](../network/iota-networks.md) in [transfer bundles](../transactions/bundles.md).**

## How the IOTA token was created

The IOTA token was launched on the Mainnet in June 2017. At this point, the nodes in the network were hard-coded with a total supply of 2,779,530,283 277,761.

This large supply allows each of the billions of devices, which are expected to be a part of the Internet of Things, to have its own wallet and transact micropayments with other devices.

## Value of the IOTA token

The IOTA token is valuable for the following reasons:

- **It's finite:** The maximum number of IOTA tokens is built into the network and can't ever be changed
- **It's useful:** To transfer value in an IOTA network, you must use the IOTA token

The value of the IOTA token is determined by supply and demand on any of the [available markets](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/iota/#markets).

## Units of IOTA tokens

Units of IOTA tokens are written in [SI notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix).

| **Unit** | **Name**       | **Amount of IOTA tokens**              |
| :---- | :---------- | :--------------------- |
| Pi   | Peta IOTA  | 1,000,000,000,000,000 |
| Ti   | Terra IOTA | 1,000,000,000,000     |
| Gi   | Giga IOTA  | 1,000,000,000         |
| Mi   | Mega IOTA  | 1,000,000             |
| Ki   | Kila IOTA  | 1,000                 |
| i    | IOTA       | 1                     |

## Utilities

You can use a service such as [IOTA Tangle Utilities](https://utils.iota.org/currency-conversion) to find out the exchange rate of IOTA tokens.

You can also use a Tangle explorer to search for statistics such as the [richest addresses](https://thetangle.org/statistics/richest-addresses).
