# The Coordinator

**The Coordinator is an application that's run by the IOTA Foundation and whose purpose is protect the [Tangle](../network/the-tangle.md) from attacks such as [parasite chains](https://blog.iota.org/attack-analysis-the-simple-parasite-chain-42a34bfeaf23). [Nodes](../network/nodes.md) use the Coordinator to reach a consensus on which transactions are confirmed.**

When you send a [transfer bundle](../transactions/bundles.md#transfer-bundles), your balance isn't updated until all the transactions in it are confirmed.

It's the Coordinator that allows your transactions to go from pending to confirmed.

The Coordinator is a program that regularly sends bundles that reference and approve two new random transactions in the ledger. The signed tail transaction in the bundle is called a milestone.

## Milestones

Every node in the same [IOTA network](../network/iota-networks.md) is hard-coded with the [address](../clients/addresses.md) of a Coordinator. So, whenever nodes see a milestone, they make sure it's valid by doing a number of checks, including:

* The milestone came from the Coordinator's address
* The milestone doesn't reference any invalid transactions

As a result, if the Coordinator were to ever send an invalid milestone such as one that references counterfeit transactions, the rest of the nodes would not accept it.

:::info:
The Coordinator can't lose tokens or reverse transactions.

When a transaction in a valid milestone references an existing transaction in the Tangle, nodes mark the state of that existing transaction and its entire history as confirmed.

## The Coordinator's Merkle tree

Because [signatures](../clients/signatures.md) prove ownership of an address and IOTA uses one-time signatures, the Coordinator needs a way to prove to nodes that it owns an address without signing bundles with the same private key every time.

To do so, the Coordinator's address is derived from a [Merkle tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree), where the address is the root, and the private keys are the leaves.

## How the Merkle tree is generated

To generate the Merkle tree, first a number of addresses and private keys are generated from the Coordinator's seed.

The total number of addresses depends on the depth of the Merkle tree in this formula:

2<sup>depth</sup>

### Example Merkle tree

In this example, the Merkle tree's depth is 2 because we have 4 leaves, which each represent an address.

:::info:
On the Mainnet, the Coordinator's Merkle tree has a depth of 23. So, the Coordinator has 8,388,608 private keys and can use each one to sign a bundle.
:::

To generate the Coordinator's address, the leaves are hashed in pairs:

- **Node 1:** Hash(Hash(leaf 1) Hash(leaf 2))
- **Node 2:** Hash(Hash(leaf 3) Hash(leaf 4))
- **Coordinator's address:** Hash(Hash(node 1) Hash(node 2))

Node 1 is a hash of the result of hashing leaf 1 and leaf 2. Node 2 is a hash of the result of hashing leaf 3 and leaf 4. The Coordinator's address is a hash of the result of hashing the hash of node 1 and node 2.

## How nodes validate milestones

To prove to nodes that it owns the address, the Coordinator's bundles contain the following:

- Enough zero-value transactions to contain the fragmented signature
- One transaction whose [`signatureMessageFragment` field](../transactions/transactions.md#signatureMessageFragment) contains enough missing data from the Merkle tree to allow the node to rebuild it

When nodes see a transaction that's been sent from the Coordinator's address, they validate it by doing the following:

- Make sure that it doesn't lead to a double-spend
- Verify its signature

![Example Merkle tree](../images/merkle-tree-example.png)

To verify the signature, nodes use the information in the milestones to rebuild the Merkle tree and find the Merkle root. If the rebuilt Merkle root is the same as the Coordinator's address, nodes know the milestone was sent by the Coordinator.

### Example milestone validation

For example, as a node, we have seen a bundle that was signed with the private key of leaf 1.

First, we [validate the signature](../clients/signatures.md#how-nodes-validate-signatures) to find out the address in leaf 1.

To help us calculate the Merkle root, one of the milestones in the bundle contains the following:

- The address in leaf 2
- The hash in node 2

Now, we hash the addresses in leaves 1 and 2 to find the hash in node 1. Then, we hash the hash in nodes 1 and 2 to find the Merkle root.

If the Merkle root is the same as the Coordinator's address, the bundle was signed with one of the private keys in the Coordinator's Merkle tree.

## Coordicide

The Research Department at the IOTA Foundation are working on a project called [Coordicide](https://coordicide.iota.org/), which is a proposal for the removal of the Coordinator. When this happens, nodes will be able to reach a consensus without milestones, making IOTA networks decentralized.
