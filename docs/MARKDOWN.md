# Markdown

The IOTA documentation uses an enhanced version of Markdown for its content.

Basic formatting for your Markdown documents can be found here <https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet>

## Enhanced Syntax

In addition to the basic Markdown syntax the documentation also supports some additional markup. The markup is intended to still look sensible when displayed by a markup reader which doesn't support the additional syntax.

### Tabbed Control

The tabbed control is fenced by a horizontal separator with 20 hyphens. The individual tabs require a regular 3 hyphen horizontal separator between them. The title of the tab is read from the level 3 header.

```markup
--------------------
### Tab Page 1
This is the content in tab page 1.
---
### Tab Page 2
This is the content in tab page 2.
--------------------
```

The above markup will produce the following output:

![Tabbed Control](./tabbed-control.png)

### Cards

Cards should be fenced with 25 hyphens. The first line is the image with alt text. The second line is a level 2 header linked to the content. Any additional content below the title will appear in the description.

```markup
-------------------------
![Data Marketplace](../images/blueprint-data-marketplace.png)
## [Data Marketplace](../data-marketplace/overview.md)
Data silos make it difficult to buy and sell data among different data points. To overcome this challenge, the Data Marketplace uses IOTA MAM channels to open up the data silos and allow users to make micropayments of IOTA tokens to the data owners in exchange for data.
-------------------------
```

### Heading Label

The heading label is formatted in a similar way to regular level 3 headings except that you also append 3 hashes as well. It can be colored as either primary or secondary by using the ** or __ wrappers around the content.

```markup
### **OFFICIAL SUPPORT** ###

### __COMMUNITY SUPPORT__ ###
```

The above markup will produce the following output:

![Heading Label](./heading-label-primary.png)

![Heading Label](./heading-label-secondary.png)

### Project Topics

Project topics also require fencing with a 15 hyphen horizontal separator. The individual project topics require a regular 3 hyphen horizontal separator between them.
The headings for the project topics are read from the level 4 header.
You can add colored bullets to the heading by wrapping the header in ** for primary and __ for secondary. An optional link can be added which will make the whole project topic linked to that url. The rest of the content is the subheader.

```markup
---------------
#### **JavaScript Library** ####
[Link](./1.0/library/JavaScript)

Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui.
---
#### __Go Library__ ####
Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui.
---
#### Python Library ####
Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui.
---------------
```

The above markup will produce the following output:

![Project Topics](./project-topics.png)

### Emojis

To embed emojis in your content add the emoji name you want surrounded by colons.

The names of available emojis can be found here [https://github.com/muan/emojilib/blob/master/emojis.json](https://github.com/muan/emojilib/blob/master/emojis.json)

```markup
:smile:
:laughing:
```

The above markup will produce the following output:

![Emojis](./emojis.png)

### Maps

A map can be embedded in your content by surrounding it with `¬¬¬` fencing. You can then specify the type as `[map]` and provide the JSON configuration for the object as follows:

```markup
¬¬¬
[map]
{
    "zoom":14,
    "center": {
        "lat": 52.5294498,
        "lng": 13.412903
    },
    "markers": [
        {
            "name": "IOTA Foundation",
            "lat": 52.5294498,
            "lng": 13.412903
        }
    ]
}
¬¬¬
```

Would display:

![Google Maps for IOTA](./maps.png)

### Data Feeds

A feed can be embedded in your content by surrounding it with `¬¬¬` fencing. You can then specify the type as `[feed]` and provide the JSON configuration for the object as follows:

```markup
¬¬¬
[feed]
{
    "displayType": "event",
    "context": "training"
}
¬¬¬
```

The `displayType` field specifies how the content will be rendered on the page and the `context` is used to determine where the data is retrieved from using the documentation api e.g. `https://docs-api.iota.org/feed/training`. The feeds list supports paging and will show it when necessary. The table of contents for the page is dynamically generated from any h2 headers in the rendered items.

Would display:

![Event Feed](./feed.png)

### Message Boxes

If you would like to display a message box in your content there are 4 variants available success, danger, warning and info. Each message box can optionally contain a title and content.

A message box is fenced using `:::`, this should then be followed by the type and then another `:`, any following content on the same line will be a title. The remaining text until the end fence `:::` will be the content.

```markup
:::success:A Success
This is the content,
on multiple lines :tada:
:::

:::warning:Just A Warning Title:::

:::info:
Some multiline content only.
This is line 2.
:::

:::danger:Danger Danger
Will Robinson :bomb:
:::
```
