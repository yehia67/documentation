# Check if a transaction is confirmed

**Before IOTA tokens can be transferred, the transactions in the [bundle](root://getting-started/0.1/transactions/bundles.md) that transfers them must be confirmed. Transactions in a bundle remain in a pending state until the tail transaction is referenced and approved by a [milestone](root://getting-started/0.1/network/the-coordinator.md).**

## Packages

To complete this guide, you need to install the `core` package:

--------------------
### npm
```bash
npm install @iota/core
```
---
### Yarn
```bash
yarn add @iota/core
```
--------------------

## IOTA network

In this guide, we connect to a node on the [Devnet](root://getting-started/0.1/network/iota-networks.md#devnet) with the following network settings:

- **[Minimum weight magnitude](root://getting-started/0.1/network/minimum-weight-magnitude.md)**: 9

- **[Depth](root://getting-started/0.1/transactions/depth.md)**: 3

## Code walkthrough

1. Go to [devnet.thetangle.org](https://devnet.thetangle.org/) and find a confirmed transaction

    :::info:Can't find a confirmed transaction?
    Click a transaction hash in the Latest milestones box, then click the branch transaction hash. This transaction is referenced and approved by the milestone, so it is in a confirmed state.
    :::

2. Pass the transaction hash to the [`getLatestInclusion()`](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.js/blob/next/api_reference.md#module_core.getLatestInclusion) method to check if the node's latest solid subtangle milestone approves it

    ```js
    iota.getLatestInclusion(['TRANSACTION HASH'])
    .then(states => console.log(states));
    ```

    When you execute the file, you should see an array that contains the `true` boolean, meaning that the transaction is confirmed.

    :::info:
    You could also use the `getInclusionStates()` method to check if a transaction is approved by an array of your own chosen transactions.
    :::

5. Go to [devnet.thetangle.org](https://devnet.thetangle.org) and find a pending transaction

    :::info:Can't find a pending transaction?
    Click a transaction hash in the Latest transactions box. This transaction is a tip, so it is in a pending state.
    :::

6. Pass the transaction hash to the `getLatestInclusion()` method to check if the IRI node's latest solid subtangle milestone approves it

    ```js
    iota.getLatestInclusion(['TRANSACTION HASH'])
    .then(states => console.log(states));
    ```

    When you execute the file, you should see an array that contains the `false` boolean, meaning that the transaction is not yet confirmed.
