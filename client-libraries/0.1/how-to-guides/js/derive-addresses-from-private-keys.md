# Generate private keys and addresses

**By deriving [addresses](root://getting-started/0.1/clients/addresses.md) from private keys, you can gain a better understanding of the relationship among addresses, private keys, and security levels.**

## Packages

To complete this guide, you need to install the following packages:

--------------------
### npm
```bash
npm install @iota/core @iota/converter @iota/signing
```
---
### Yarn
```bash
yarn add @iota/core @iota/converter @iota/signing
```
--------------------

## Step 1. Generate private keys

In this example, we use the [`signing` package](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.js/tree/next/packages/signing) to derive private keys from a seed, index 0, and all security levels.

1. Generate a subseed by passing a seed in trits and an index to the `subseed()` method

    ```js
    const seed = "PUETTSEITFEVEWCWBTSIZM9NKRGJEIMXTULBACGFRQK9IMGICLBKW9TTEVSDQMGWKBXPVCBMMCXWMNPDX";

    var subseed = Sign.subseed(Converter.trytesToTrits(seed), 0 /*index*/);
    ```

2. Generate one private key for each of the three security levels by passing the same subseed and a different security level to the `key()` method

    ```js
    var privateKey1 = Sign.key(subseed, 1 /*security level*/);

    console.log('Private key length for security level 1: ' + Converter.tritsToTrytes(privateKey1).length);

    var privateKey2 = Sign.key(subseed, 2 /*security level*/);

    console.log('Private key length for security level 2: ' + Converter.tritsToTrytes(privateKey2).length);

    var privateKey3 = Sign.key(subseed, 3 /*security level*/);

    console.log('Private key length for security level 3: ' + Converter.tritsToTrytes(privateKey3).length);
    ```

    When you execute the file, you should see the length of each private key in trytes:

    ```console
    Private key length for security level 1: 2187

    Private key length for security level 2: 4374

    Private key length for security level 3: 6561
    ```

## Step 2. Derive addresses from the private keys

Now you have private keys, you can derive addresses from them.

1. Generate the key digests for each private key by passing each one to the `digests()` method

    ```js
    var privateKey1Digests = Sign.digests(privateKey1);

    console.log(`Total key digests for security level 1: ` + Converter.tritsToTrytes(privateKey1Digests).length/81);

    var privateKey2Digests = Sign.digests(privateKey2);

    console.log(`Total key digests for security level 2: ` + Converter.tritsToTrytes(privateKey2Digests).length/81);

    var privateKey3Digests = Sign.digests(privateKey3);

    console.log(`Total key digests for security level 3: ` + Converter.tritsToTrytes(privateKey3Digests).length/81);
    ```

    When you execute the file, you should see the number of key digests for each private key:

    ```console
    Total key digests for security level 1: 1

    Total key digests for security level 2: 2

    Total key digests for security level 3: 3
    ```

2. Generate an address for each private key by passing the digests to the `address()` method

    ```js
    var privateKey1Address = Sign.address(privateKey1Digests);

    console.log('Address with security level 1: ' + Converter.tritsToTrytes(privateKey1Address));

    var privateKey2Address = Sign.address(privateKey2Digests);

    console.log('Address with security level 2: ' + Converter.tritsToTrytes(privateKey2Address));

    var privateKey3Address = Sign.address(privateKey3Digests);

    console.log('Address with security level 3: ' + Converter.tritsToTrytes(privateKey3Address));
    ```

    When you execute the file, you should see the addresses for each security level:

    ```console
    Address with security level 1: ZWENNY9JOIQRJIRHV9PCQMCHKBXVZTTKMVRSZSKQNQCQCTZMTMUPEWE9DPCVBVZOVGFFI9JYLTIFXGJAX
    Address with security level 2: ECMHBSFPVUWHSUXZBXTWSKNMBGNTW9GAFVJUUSSJYFBOKHNFJBPEKJNMQMCSAIBXVUJNQKUBFUXPEIY9B
    Address with security level 3: LJGSYD9N9JEAQ9AVN9BJCAOW9LFVZGFHOXFVFVLQEBKVZFGBIDJJIRK9FBJUKRS9VMUXTCXBRIOOEMQJ9
    ```

3. To check that the same addresses would be returned from the `core` package, do the following:

    ```js
    console.log(Iota.generateAddress(seed, 0 /*index*/, 1 /*security level*/));
    console.log(Iota.generateAddress(seed, 0 /*index*/, 2 /*security level*/));
    console.log(Iota.generateAddress(seed, 0 /*index*/, 3 /*security level*/));
    ```

    You should see the same addresses in the output.
    
:::success:Congratulations :tada:
You've proven that, under the hood of the IOTA core library, addresses are derived from private keys with a certain index and security level.
