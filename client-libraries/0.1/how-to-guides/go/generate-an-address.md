# Generate an address in Go

**In this guide, you learn how to generate a new address for a [seed](root://getting-started/0.1/clients/seeds.md) with a given [security level](root://getting-started/0.1/clients/security-levels.md).**

## Packages

To complete this guide, you need to install the following packages (if you're using Go modules, you just need to reference them):

```bash
go get github.com/iotaledger/iota.go/api
go get github.com/iotaledger/iota.go/trinary
```

## IOTA network

In this guide, we connect to a [node](root://getting-started/0.1/network/nodes.md) on the [Devnet](root://getting-started/0.1/network/iota-networks.md#devnet).

## Code walkthrough

1. Import the packages

    ```go
    package main

    import (
        . "github.com/iotaledger/iota.go/api"
        "github.com/iotaledger/iota.go/trinary"
        "fmt"
    )
    ```
    
2. Connect to a node

    ```go
    var node = "https://nodes.devnet.thetangle.org"
    api, err := ComposeAPI(HTTPClientSettings{URI: node})
    must(err)
    ```

3. Define the security level that you want to use for your address

    ```go
    const securityLevel = 2;
    ```

4. Define a seed for which to generate an address

    ```go
    const seed = trinary.Trytes("PUETPSEITFEVEWCWBTSIZM9NKRGJEIMXTULBACGFRQK9IMGICLBKW9TTEVSDQMGWKBXPVCBMMCXWMNPDX")
    ```

5. Use the [`GetNewAddress()`](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.go/blob/master/.docs/iota.go/reference/api_get_new_address.md) method to generate an unspent address

    ```go
    addresses, err := api.GetNewAddress(seed, GetNewAddressOptions{Security:securityLevel})
    must(err)

    fmt.Println("\nYour address is: ", addresses[0])
    ```

Starting from the given index, the connected node checks the following:

- If any input transactions (pending or confirmed) in its view of the Tangle withdraw from the address
- If the address is in the node's list of spent addresses (addresses that were withdrawn from in confirmed transactions)

If an address with the given index is spent, the index is incremented until the node finds one that isn't spent.

:::warning:
This way of generating addresses replies on the node to return valid data about your addresses. To have more control over your addresses, we recommend using the [account module](../../account-module/introduction/overview.md) to keep track of spent addresses in your own local database.
:::

In the console, you should see an address.

```
Your address is: WKJDF9LVQCVKEIVHFAOMHISHXJSGXWBJFYEQPOQKSVGZZFLTUUPBACNQZTAKXR9TFVKBGYSNSPHRNKKHA
```

:::success:Congratulations :tada:
You've just generated a new unspent address. You can share this address with anyone who wants to send you a transaction.
