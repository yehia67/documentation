# Listen for live transactions in Python

**In this guide, you listen to the Tangle for confirmed transactions by subscribing to the [zero message queue (ZMQ)](https://zeromq.org/) on [nodes](root://getting-started/0.1/network/nodes.md) that run the [IRI node software](root://node-software/0.1/iri/introduction/overview.md).**

## Packages

To complete this guide, you need to install the following package:

```bash
pip install zmq
```

## IOTA network

In this guide, we connect to a node on the [Devnet](root://getting-started/0.1/network/iota-networks.md#devnet).

## Code walkthrough

1. Import the packages

    ```python
    import zmq
    ```

2. Connect the socket to a node's ZMQ port

    ```python
    context = zmq.Context()
	socket = context.socket(zmq.SUB)
    socket.connect('tcp://zmq.devnet.iota.org:5556')
    ```

3. Subscribe to the [`sn`](root://node-software/0.1/iri/references/zmq-events.md) event to see confirmed transactions

    ```python
    socket.subscribe('sn')
    print ("Socket connected")
    ```

4. Process the event data that the node returns

    ```python
    while True:
        print ("Waiting for events from the node")
        message = socket.recv()
        data = message.split()
        print ("Transaction confirmed by milestone index: ", data[1])
        print ("Transaction hash: ", data[2])
    ```

    In the console, you should see transaction data.

:::info:
It may take a minute or two to receive data from the node.
