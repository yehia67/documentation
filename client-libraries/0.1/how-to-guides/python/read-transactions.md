# Read transactions from the Tangle in Python

**In this guide, you read your "hello world" [transaction](root://getting-started/0.1/transactions/transactions.md) from the Tangle by giving a [node](root://getting-started/0.1/network/nodes.md) your tail transaction hash.**

## Packages

To complete this guide, you need to install the following package:

```bash
pip install pyota
```

## IOTA network

In this guide, we connect to a node on the [Devnet](root://getting-started/0.1/network/iota-networks.md#devnet).

## Code walkthrough

1. Import the packages

    ```python
    from iota import Iota
    ```

2. Connect to a node

    ```python
    api = Iota('https://nodes.devnet.iota.org:443', testnet = True)
    ```

3. Define the tail transaction hash of the bundle

    ```python
    tail_transaction_hash = 'ZFICKFQXASUESAWLSFFIWHVOAJCSJHJNXMRC9AJSIOTNGNKEWOFLECHPULLJSNRCNJPYNZEC9VGOSV999'
    ```

    :::info:
    We use the tail transaction hash because the `signatureMessageFragment` field is part of the hash. Therefore, the message in the transaction is immutable.

    If you were to use the bundle hash, you may see a different message because anyone can change the message in the tail transaction and attach a copy of the bundle to the Tangle.
    :::

4. Use the [`get_bundles()`](https://pyota.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extended_api.html?highlight=getbundles#get-bundles) method to get all transactions in the tail transaction's bundle

    ```python
    bundle = api.get_bundles(tail_transaction_hash)
    ```

5. Convert the message in the bundle's first transaction to ASCII characters and print it to the console

    ```python
    message = bundle['bundles'][0].tail_transaction.signature_message_fragment
    print(message.decode())
    ```

    In the console, you should see your message:

    ```
    Hello world
    ```
