# Node software

**IOTA networks consist of interconnected nodes, which are computers that run the same node software. This software gives nodes read/write access to the Tangle and allows them to validate transactions and store them in their ledgers.**

## [IRI](../iri/introduction/overview.md)
The IRI (IOTA reference implementation) is open-source Java software that runs on the IOTA Mainnet. This software defines the current IOTA protocol, which allows clients to transfer the IOTA token among each other.

Chronicle is an addition to the IRI node software that allows you to store all transactions in a separate distributed database that's secure and scales well.

## [GoShimmer](../goshimmer/introduction/overview.md)
GoShimmer is open-source Go software that implements a prototype of an IOTA network without the Coordinator. This network is still in development, so not all modules exist, but new ones will be added when they are ready.
