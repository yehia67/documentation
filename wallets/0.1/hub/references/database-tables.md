# Database tables

**Hub manages users' IOTA tokens by recording information such as deposit addresses and withdrawal requests in database tables. You can find this information by using the gRPC API or by querying the database server.**


| **Table**      | **Description**|
|:-----------|:------------|
| `hub_address`          | About the Hub owner's addresses. These addresses are where remainder tokens are sent during sweeps.|
| `hub_address_balance`  |About updates to the balance of the Hub owner's addresses. Hub updates this table whenever it completes an action that involves one of the addresses.|
| `signed_uuids`         |A record of the seed UUIDs for addresses that have been withdrawn from (also known as used or spent) |
| `sweep`                | About confirmed and pending sweeps|
| `sweep_tails`          |About the tail transactions of sweeps. Hub uses this table to check if a sweep is confirmed. |
| `user_account`         |About users' Hub accounts |
| `user_account_balance` | About the balances of users' Hub accounts|
| `user_address`         |About the users' deposit addresses |
| `user_address_balance` |About the balance of users' deposit addresses. Hub updates this table whenever it completes an action that involves one of the addresses. |
| `withdrawal`           | About the balance of users' withdrawal requests|


## Hub_address

This table contains information about the Hub owner's addresses to which the tokens in users' deposit addresses are transferred in sweeps.
