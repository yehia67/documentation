# Outsource proof of work

**By default [proof of work](root://getting-started/0.1/transactions/proof-of-work.md) is done on the computer that is running Trinity. In this guide, you learn how to ask one of the connected nodes to do proof of work instead.**

:::danger:
On 11 February 2020, the IOTA Foundation became aware of an attack on the Trinity wallet, during which some users’ seeds and Trinity passwords were compromised. Please check our advice for [protecting your Trinity account](../how-to-guides/protect-trinity-account.md).
