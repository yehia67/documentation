# Internet of Things overview

**The Internet of Things (IoT) is an umbrella term for billions of Internet-connected devices that share data with each other. Thanks to this data-sharing network, IoT is becoming the driving force in creating more efficient communication across many aspects of our lives. IOTA allows these devices to use the Tangle as a single source of truth, where they can buy, sell, or simply send data among each other for zero fees.**

Because sensors will soon be found in homes, automobiles, stores, shipping, and almost every environment you pass through, speed, trust and reliability are paramount. Proofs of concept and use cases using IOTA open source technology are being developed across every sector of IoT, including:

- Mobility and Automotive
- Global Trade and Supply Chain
- eHealth
- Smart Energy (including Smart Cities)
- Industrial IoT
- Social Impact and Public Regulatory Affairs

In this series of articles, we start from the basics to show you how to set up small devices such as microcontrollers on the Internet of Things. Then, as you become more confident, we connect these devices to the Tangle, so that you can attach immutable sensor data to it for other devices to read or even buy.
